# Hello world docker action

This action prints "Hello World" to the log or "Hello" + the name of a person to greet. To learn how this action was built, see "[Creating a Docker container action](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-docker-container-action)" in the GitHub Help documentation.

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

## Inputs
